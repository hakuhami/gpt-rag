As part of the green energy revolution, we at Canadian Solar recognize the crucial role we will play in those eﬀorts. Our commitments to environmental sustainability, human rights, and positive social impact thus represent both our eﬀorts to safeguard our shared future and our dedication to building long-term value for all our stakeholders. In last year’s report, we reaﬃrmed our longstanding commitment to reducing our environmental impact while empowering our customers to do the same. Our use of more comprehensive environmental standards has helped us deliver more energy and materially eﬃcient products with lower carbon footprints in all stages of production, such as our BiHiKu6 and BiHiKu7 modules, unveiled in 2021. Likewise, despite expanding production output, we achieved year-on-year improvements in energy intensity, water intensity, and waste intensity in 2021 and kept increases in GHG emissions intensity within 4% even after recalculating our environmental metrics using more holistic calculation standards. Overall, we remain on track to meeting our goal of using 100% renewable energy in our operations before 2030.",

These innovations have helped reduce the LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) of solar systems to unprecedentedly low levels by improving durability and lowering manufacturing costs for solar modules. They have also enabled signiﬁcant improvements in the environmental payback time of solar modules, as measured in GHG emissions and energy use, as well as other key environmental metrics, such as water and waste intensities. In 2016, we designed the ﬁrst half-cell solar modules in the industry, which improved solar module power output, performance, and durability. In the years following, we successfully launched polycrystalline Passivated Rear Emission Contact (PERC) cells and overcame the 400W module wattage limit by mass-producing 166mm wafer size modules, ﬁrsts for the industry. All these technological improvements contributed meaningfully to improving the performance and reliability of solar energy while reducing its cost. More recently, we have introduced even larger wafers and have continued to make product design and eﬃciency improvements, increasing our solar module eﬃciencies from 13.9% in 2010 to 21.2% in 2021. These improvements have allowed us to more than double our module power output from 278W in 2010 to 660W in 2021 (larger utility module type HiKu7). Continuous technological innovations have allowed us to reduce silicon usage and increase the power output of our solar modules, thereby reducing both the environmental footprint of our production on a per watt basis and the BOS (balance of systems) costs for solar projects.",

    "data": "Understanding the Environmental Impact of Manufacturing To fully comprehend the environmental results and targets reported in the following sections, it is important to understand the impact of our manufacturing operations structure on deﬁned environmental metrics, which can be evaluated through the following framework: • Scale of production & process eﬃciency. The more we produce, the more energy and water we consume and the more waste and GHG emissions we release. However, the more eﬃcient our processes are, the smaller our energy and water consumption and the lower our waste and GHG production will be per unit produced. As such, energy eﬃciency has been one critical parameter for selecting manufacturing processes and equipment. • Level of manufacturing vertical integration. Crystalline silicon PV manufacturing comprises of the processes of ingot, wafer, cell, and module production. We may outsource the production of such materials, and each production process has diﬀerent environmental impact intensities. Changes to our own manufacturing capacity structure would thus directly impact our total environmental footprint. For example, the higher our level of manufacturing vertical integration is, the more energy we would consume in-house to produce a given volume of module products. • Product technologies. To a large extent, the choice of product technologies deﬁnes the environmental impact of our manufacturing process. For instance, Heterojunction (HJT) cell manufacturing consumes roughly 30% less energy than the competing TOPCon technology. At the same time, products based on new technologies have higher conversion eﬃciency, helping reduce per-watt energy, water, and material consumption, as well as waste and GHG emissions, when in operation.",

The combined production output of our manufacturing operations, once converted to a common unit in Megawatts (MW), rose by 37% year-over-year, with actual production outputs of our ingot, wafer, cell, and module operations increasing by 91%, 56%, 14%, and 40%, respectively. The increase in production scale, along with the shift to monocrystalline ingoting technology, led to higher absolute energy consumption, water withdrawal, and waste production in 2021. In 2022, we are transitioning to a trapezoid-shaped manufacturing capacity structure by increasing our ingot, wafer, and cell capacities each to around 20 GW and our module capacity to 32 GW. We thus expect our environmental metrics, in particularly energy consumption, to increase next year purely due to the magnitude of our increase in production scale despite continued decreases in the energy intensity of our manufacturing processes.

To simplify comparison across diﬀerent years, we use GHG emissions intensity or carbon intensity (emissions per MWp) as our main reporting metric. In 2021, we were able to keep our increase in carbon intensity within 4% while still bolstering production output and switching to more energy-intensive monocrystalline ingoting technology. Improvements in cell and module eﬃciency, faster adoption of thinner wafers, and deployment of new, less energy-intensive production tools helped realize a 16% (1.6 tCO2 e/MWp) and 3% (1.7 tCO2 e/MWp) reduction in our wafer and cell operations carbon intensities, respectively. In 2022, we plan to achieve a moderate decrease in our carbon intensity of around 5% (6 tCO2 e/MWp) as the share of monocrystalline ingot production continues increasing, pushing up our ingot operations energy consumption.

The technology oﬀers a greater uplift in energy conversion eﬃciency, minimal degradation, and simpler, less energy intensive manufacturing processes.

A detailed comparison with our 2020 GHG emissions, broken down into sub-categories, can be found in the table below. Within Category 1 or Scope 1 emissions, we observed an increase in process emissions related to a new cell manufacturing process we deployed in 2021.

    "data": "Case Study: Solar PV System’s GHG Payback Time (Generally 1+ Years) When evaluating a technology’s potential against global warming, the most comprehensive metric remains net GHG emissions avoided. For solar systems, net emissions avoided are calculated by multiplying total GHG-free energy production by the local electricity grid emissions rates, then discounting the solar system’s carbon footprint, which takes into consideration the GHG emissions from its entire life cycle, including those from manufacturing solar modules and components, transportation, construction, operation, and decommissioning. For illustrative purposes, we estimate the net GHG avoided emissions and the GHG payback time—the time it takes for excess GHG emissions associated with the system’s production and installation to be oﬀset by the system’s net GHG avoided emissions—of our systems using two utility-scale solar projects that are 200 MWp each, one located in Texas, the United States, and the other in Côte d’Azur, France. Both are built with Canadian Solar’s BiHiKu7 bifacial modules, use single-axis solar trackers, and are assumed to produce electricity for 30 years before decommissioning. We compare the GHG payback time of this baseline scenario with a project using a specialty low-carbon long-lifetime module design. The solar plant in Texas is reﬂective of the GHG payback time of most markets, as the share of fossil fuels in Texas’s electricity mix amounts to approximately to 65%, compared to the global average of 62%7. The projected Texas GHG payback time of one year coheres with the GHG payback times typical in countries with larger populations and the highest electricity consumptions (China, US, India, Russia, Japan), further supporting these results. This means that after 12 months or so of electricity generation, plants like the Texas plant will generate close to 100% emissions-free electricity for the remainder of their useful lives. Even in markets whose energy grids are already decarbonized, such as France (the French electricity grid relies mostly on nuclear energy, a non-renewable low-carbon energy source), GHG payback times may only increase to just over 10 years, which remains attractive from a decarbonization standpoint given that the lifetime of fuels-based electricity production assets usually exceeds 40 years. As research in photovoltaics continues, the development of less energy-intensive and more durable systems, along with electricity decarbonization, will further decrease GHG payback times. Our system installed with specialty low-carbon modules with a 40-year lifespan, for example, has a 20-month shorter GHG payback time when installed in France than the baseline system.",

    "data": "Module Carbon Footprint Improvement We have been developing and oﬀering our customers PV modules with an optimized carbon footprint supply chain in compliance with the French Energy Regulation Committee (CRE) solar tender requirements since 2015. The CRE module carbon footprint analysis is more comprehensive than the corporate GHG emissions intensity analysis, as it also includes the indirect GHG emissions from the upstream manufacturing of raw materials, up to material mining. When we expanded our competitive low carbon footprint supply chain to include our BiHiKu6 and BiHiKu7 products in 2021, we also implemented new third party Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis in our most recent production facilities inaccordance with ISO14040/44:2006 environmental management standards. LCA methodology requires analysis of all stages of product manufacturing, including raw material extraction and making of materials used; transportation of raw materials and intermediate products; manufacturing of allcomponents, including packaging, energy and water consumption, emissions, and waste, as well as infrastructure dedicated to product manufacturing. Under this comprehensive framework, our latest ingot, wafer, and module manufacturing facilities were granted reduced Global Warming Potential (GWP) factors by the French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME – Agence de l’Environnement et de la Maitrise de l’Energie). Compared to our previous HiKu product generation, our HiKu6 module carbon footprint has decreased to 500tCO2 e/MW, 6.0% lower than that of our prior HiKu product8.The chart on the right presents our short-term roadmap to further bring down our modules’ carbon footprint calculations based on French CRE methodology, with 2020 as the base year for our roadmap. These calculations include gate-to-gate carbon emissions for a standard double glass module design. Meanwhile, we are progressing with our ﬁrst Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) certiﬁcations, expanding our analysis to a full-lifecycle carbon emission evaluation, which involves consideration of downstream transportation, solar plant construction, operations and maintenance, and end-of-life disposal. This will provide a more complete picture of how our products contribute during their whole life cycles, allowing us to develop tools to guide our customers, particularly by empowering solar plant owners to calculate their projects’ GHG payback time. The Product Carbon Footprint (CFP) Reduction Roadmap shows a planned decrease in emissions for both PERC and HJT technologies from 2020 to 2025.\nFor PERC, the carbon footprint is expected to decrease from 100% in 2020 to 80% in 2025, with milestones at 94% in 2021, 89% in 2022, 82% in 2023, and 81% in 2024.\nFor HJT, the carbon footprint starts at 89% in 2022 and drops to 65% by 2025, with intermediary steps of 72% in 2023 and 66% in 2024.\nKey reduction methods include:\nEfficiency improvement\nThinner wafer technology\nProcess energy savings\nSteel frame optimization\nArgon recycling",

Water intensity is deﬁned as the total amount of water withdrawn from all sources per MW produced. We use production-weighted averages across all our manufacturing units to track our water intensity, as shown in the chart above. We achieved a 15% year-on-year reduction in water intensity between 2020 and 2021, mainly driven by the incremental deployment of new large size 210mm wafer and cell operations, as well as further decreases in silicon use (down to 2.5 g/W by the end of the year), which allowed us to reduce water use per watt of production. The photovoltaic industry supply chain and integrated manufacturing can be water intensive, particularly as more and more complex cell technologies gain market share, increasing demand for ultra-pure water quality. At Canadian Solar, we have been cognizant of the challenges this may pose to our long-term operations and sustainability. Our water conservation and recycling schemes, combined with the improvements in module eﬃciency and production yield, helped drive a 53% reduction in manufacturing water intensity between 2017 and 2021.

As such, we constantly seek to improve process utilization rates and reduce water withdrawal in our water management strategy. When designing production processes, we maximize water utilization rates by considering the water quality requirements for each process and recycling discharged water ﬂows the appropriate number of times to achieve that quality. In 2021, 100% of our water withdrawals came from municipal fresh water supplies. All statistics on water withdrawals and discharges, as shown on the table on the right, are based on invoices provided by water and waste water utilities, respectively. Recycled water quantities are based on direct meter measurements within our various facilities. Our wafer and cell manufacturing operations accounted for 79% of our total water withdrawals in 2021. Thanks to our water intensity reduction achievements (35% and 10% for wafer and cell operations, respectively), our total water withdrawal increase was limited to roughly 7% (609,000 m3, of which 118,000 m3 was used in our auxiliary materials manufacturing facilities). More importantly, our total water consumption decreased by approximately 27%, a change driven by more eﬃcient production tools and stricter water conservation management. Our total water recycling rate went down to 21% in 2021, primarily due to our rapid transition from poly- to monocrystalline upstream wafer and ingot manufacturing. The closure of our Suzhou cellfactory during the ﬁrst half of 2021 exacerbated this decrease, as this site has historically had the highest water recycling rate among our cell operations (about 45%). In 2022, we expect our corporate aggregated water recycling rate to signiﬁcantly improve, exceeding 35%, which, alongside our other water conservation measures, will reduce our water intensity by an additional 22%.

In 2021, around 184,882 pieces of Canadian Solar modules (totaling 40 MW, or approximately 3.4 tons) were repaired for reuse by Rinovasol Group, and around 5,719 pieces, or 1.2 MW, were recycled by PV CYCLE. In Australia, Canadian Solar partners with Reclaim PV Recycling (link) for solar module end-of-life management activities. In 2021, 3,209 pieces of modules totaling 0.7 MW, or 0.6 tons, were recycled through Reclaim PV Recycling. The aluminum frames were disassembled and sold to aluminum recycling companies, and the remaining module parts were broken down into parts using thermal deconstruction.

Most of these emissions came from oﬃce electricity consumption and business travel.

Our solar solutions, combined with battery storage, are thus ideal for this market. At the project level, ongoing consultation with local communities and government oﬃcials is crucial throughout the development, construction, and operation phases of our projects.

The grid was built to service large loads from large generation centers in each state, creating a grid connection problem for renewable projects, which are sited in remote areas with weak grid infrastructure. To address this issue, we complete multiple studies for each project with the network service provider, as well as ensuring that our equipment will integrate with the system and that commissioning and construction activities are detailed in our contracts. Further, marginal loss factor and curtailment during project operation can impact the asset’s lifetime generation. As a prerequisite to any investment, and as requested during our ﬁnancing process, we thus commission reputable ﬁrms to produce long-term forecasts, which are vetted by technical advisors and ﬁnanciers. In the development process, we actively engage rule-making bodies, such as the Australian Energy Market Commission, as well as monitoring any energy policy changes that are proposed by the State and Federal Government. Our goal is to advocate for the most cost-eﬀective energy transition to a lower emissions electricity network that will increasingly focus on solar and hybrid projects that incorporate energy storage and technical innovations not previously featured in the Australian network. Given the rapid renewable energy and electriﬁcation targets in Australia, it is increasingly important for communities and stakeholders to be a primary focus of our development. Constant engagement with these stakeholders allows us to comprehensively address local concerns during the project development process.

Our supplier audits cover quality control, environment, health, safety, human rights, business ethics, and other sustainability aspects based on our Supplier Code of Conduct. Failure to meet Canadian Solar’s standards or Code may result in termination of the business relationship, especially if warnings are not properly addressed. Canadian Solar provides suppliers with trainings on compliance with the Code and consultations on how to improve in line with ESG priorities. We map our supplier base on an annual basis to identify critical suppliers based on purchase volumes and potential ESG risks associated with suppliers’ industry sector, size, and type of work performed. We also split critical suppliers into three groups based on their ESG risks, as shown in the following table. We conduct on site or desk audits to all our critical suppliers and 5-10% of our non-critical suppliers on an annual basis. On-site and desktop ESG audits are conducted in the form of supplier questionnaires supported by evidentiary documentation. Canadian Solar reviews the answers and supporting documents either on-site or remotely. The audits evaluate suppliers on a range of criteria divided between veto and scored criteria. Veto criteria are evaluated on a yes or no basis (i.e., the supplier is either qualiﬁed or not). Any negative answers automatically disqualify suppliers from conducting business with us. For example, the potential presence of forced or child labor based on our audit would automatically render the supplier ineligible to work with Canadian Solar. Scored factors require suppliers to achieve a minimum total score of 60 to qualify to work with us. We issue warnings to suppliers that fall below minimum scoring requirements and provide them with consultations to address the identiﬁed issues.

Since launching Scotia RISE in 2021, we have invested more than $100 million in over 200 organizations that are removing barriers for disadvantaged groups. We distributed a cumulative $3 million since 2021 through our Net-Zero Research Fund to advance leading research and technology to support decarbonization. We have also furthered ally ship through the introduction of new Global Inclusive Standards of Care for our employee benefits, with an initial focus on closing health gaps for the LGBT+ community and women.This year, for the first time, we are providing an additional 2023 Climate Report. It shares greater detail on our progress, including the Bank’s provision of climate financing, our latest financed emissions target for the automotive sector, and a reinforcement of our ambition — which we increased this year — to reduce the Bank’s own Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 40% by 2030 relative to 2016 levels. The transition to a low-carbon economy will be a challenging journey and will require partnership and collaboration across all segments of society.

Our business lines are responsible for day-to-day risk management activities, while our Global Risk Management team and Board of Directors oversee our risk management program. Our risk management processes and control structures enable the Board, executive management and employees to identify, assess,measure, monitor and report ESG risks. Our enterprise-wide Risk Appetite Framework includes an ESG performance metric that serves as a risk appetite metric. We base our composite measure of ESG risk in our framework on sub-metrics, which inform reputational, credit and operational risk categories. Our ESG performance metric helps ensure alignment with the Bank’s overall business and financial strategies, and the Bank’s risk appetite operates within acceptable ESG risk tolerance levels. Examples included in the metric are portfolio-level high-transition risk exposure and operational risk events attributed to environmental events. We internally report against this metric quarterly to the Risk Committee of the Board similarly to other risk appetite metrics. For more information on how we oversee and manage risk, see our 2024 Management Proxy Circular (pp. 31–32, 43–47) and our 2023 Annual Report (pp. 73–75, 109–111).

Similar to 2021, 2022 was a transformative year for Whitecap with strategic property acquisitions and divestitures of non-core assets. These exciting advancements did not distract us from our long-term goal of being a sustainability leader. Before discussing speciﬁc sustainability initiatives and successes, it will be helpful to brieﬂy recount the developments of 2022 to provide context and a foundation for our plans moving forward.

These were set in association with our transition to a sustainability-linked loan (“SLL”) on our credit facility with our banking syndicate. Since 2020, Whitecap has been transformed by acquisition. To ensure that progress towards a target is not unduly inﬂuenced by acquisitions, it is important to account for the impact of acquisitions and divestments (“A&D”) by re-baselining. This ensures that our targets cover 100% of our assets. Re-baselining involves recalculating historical emissions and intensities back to our baseline year to include assets we acquired and remove assets we sold. This normalizes the performance data year-over-year so we can accurately track our progress. We also conduct third-party veriﬁcation of our target baseline and any restatements. Our A&D activity over the past two years has been signiﬁcant and 60% of our emissions in the recalculated 2020 baseline were from assets we did not operate at that time. Since 2020, our combined assets reduced absolute scope 1 emissions by 13% and scope 2 emissions by 11%. This was offset by production declines across the asset base resulting from decreased capital development programs through the COVID pandemic. Overall, our scope 1 & 2 intensity has decreased over 6% in relation to our target, though we expect to improve this trend as we actively develop these assets, increase production, and bring existing facilities closer to capacity. Collectively, we’ve reduced our absolute methane emissions 18% since 2020, decreasing our methane intensity nearly 15% in relation to our target. We expect our progress towards these targets will accelerate as we focus on organic growth, optimizing our asset base, and reducing emissions.\nThe Sustainability-Linked Loan Targets include two key objectives:\nA 30% reduction in methane intensity by 2025.\nA 15% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 intensity by 2025.\nThese targets align financial goals with sustainability commitments, incentivizing environmental improvements.",

For instance, Cartier decided to vertically integrate renewable energy production to cover the Manufacture’s electricity needs for production, lighting, heating and air conditioning. This production of renewable energy is possible due to 3 800 m2 of solar panels on the roof of the Manufacture, as well as a hydroelectric power station located in Santa Maria Maggiore in the Italian Alps, in which Cartier has invested.

OUR APPROACH TO WASTE MANAGEMENT In 2020, Richemont implemented a comprehensive waste classiﬁcation system, enabling us to collect waste data by type and end-of-life options across our manufacturing sites, warehouses, oﬃces and boutiques. In 2022, we reﬁned our metrics to diﬀerentiate between hazardous and non-hazardous waste, aligning with the GRI Standards. Our Environmental Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to monitoring resource consumption and reducing waste. We ensure that hazardous and toxic materials are treated in accordance with local and international regulations and we carefully manage the use of hazardous chemicals to mitigate potential environmental harm. Our waste types include: domestic/municipal, cardboard waste and Special Industrial Waste (SIW), other waste types are detailed in the Environment data set at the end of the chapter.

Importantly, poorly managed tree plantations can result in net-positive carbon emissions (as opposed to functioning as carbon sinks). House of Baukjen is committed to sourcing its wood-pulp materials from sustainable sources, causing no deforestation and with as small an environmental footprint as possible. We have signed the Canopy Packpledge to purchase only paper products with forestry certifications and increase recycled content, and Canopy Style pledge to source all man-made cellulosic fibres from audited, “Green Shirt” suppliers. In 2022, all of our purchased paper products (packaging, catalogues, garment tags) had a Forestry certificate. 100% of all our man-made cellulosic fibres (viscose, lyocell, rayon) were made from wood-fibres harvested without causing deforestation, with 100% of MMCF coming from Canopy “Green Shirt” suppliers by end of 2021. In 2022 we used for the first time a viscose material made from recycled cotton feedstock, called Ecojilin.

    "data": "Wool Wool being an animal fibre, one of the key issues associated with its sourcing is animal welfare – as sheep being reared for wool can be subject to a number of practices that cause them harm and pain, such as mulesing and physical abuse. The rearing of sheep can contribute to a decrease in natural biodiversity (both because of the culling of natural predators and competing species, and due to the grazing of the sheep), water pollution due to the unnatural accumulation of phosphates and nitrates in the soil leading to eutrophication of nearby water channels. Run-off of contaminated waters can pose a health risk to local communities. House of Baukjen has in recent years limited its use of virgin wool fibres. In 2022, only 49% of our wool was virgin material, with the remaining 51% coming from recycled sources. All of our virgin wool fibres are mulesing-free. This does not reassure us of how sheep rearing might be impacting the surrounding environment, so further supply chain transparency and data is needed to establish the actual impact of animal farming in our supply chain. To address this, we’ve been working toward transparency of virgin wool fibres origin and assessing potential environmental risks by using tools such as the Global Fibre Impact Explorer 2. In 2022 we started working with yarn from Yorkshirecounty, using wool from Blue faced Leicester and Masham sheep. The yarn travels less than 50 miles from farm to finished material, and garments are then being produced around the same area. Our strategy for sourcing wool is to continue using Recycled Wool and Recycled Cashmere more than virgin wool fibres, moving toward Regenerative Wool where virgin fibres continue to be sourced.",

Our leather originates in New Zealand and Europe, suppliers are certified for Animal Welfare practices and are not known to be impacting deforestation. Animal agriculture has a significant environmental impact due to the emissions from raising cattle, changes in land use and consumption of resources. Furthermore, its potential to contaminate soil and waterways is significant and often a leading cause of eutrophication in rivers and lagoons. In this way, antibiotics and hormones can also enter the surrounding ecosystems, with a potential to impact fauna and flora. At production, the processing of hides into leather can also have a number of negative impacts on surrounding environment and communities due to use of chemical substances. Our strategy for addressing impacts associated with leather is to limit its use, use vegetable tanned leather when possible and explore other tanning technologies that lower environmental impact. Furthermore, we are committed to finding alternatives to animal leather but are not yet using any “vegan leather” materials as options available in the market are largely synthetic and do not compete in longevity.

In 2021 our office moved to a Certified Green Building which benefits from having its own solar panels for generation of renewable energy and heat solar pumps for hot water. It also has a number of efficiency features, from all light bulbs being LEDs to windows being positioned in such a way as to maximize airflow and minimize the need for air conditioning in the warmer months. Our warehouse is likewise equipped with a number of energy saving features and staff is instructed on how to run the facility in as efficient a manner as possible. Portugal, where over 88% of our Tier 1 production was located for the year, with a significant portion of Tier 2 and 3 production also, reported being 58% powered by renewable energy in 2022. 19% our direct and indirect suppliers in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Bulgaria have on-site generation of renewable energy, the majority through solar panels. Some suppliers have also the capacity to generate electricity from process-generated steam in their facilities, one has a cogeneration plant. Further, all suppliers we have spoken with about efficiency measures being adopted at their facilities have pointed this out to be a priority as a result of the rising energy prices. We are working to increasingly use primary data from our tier 1 suppliers to calculate energy consumption at manufacturing, which we had aimed to achieve in 2022 but remains a work in progress.",

As it is a complex area of study and impacted by a variety of other ecological boundaries, it can also act as a good indicator of planetary health. Whilst we don’t have a key metric to look at our performance in relation to biodiversity, we assess our impact on other key planetary boundaries (as defined in the Doughnut Diagram created by Kate Raworth). The boundaries we look at in relation to our contributions to Biodiversity are: - Chemical pollution, which you can read more about in the chapter Production, under Management of Chemicals in Products- Phosphorous loading, or Eutrophication, which we started tracking in 2021 using secondary data from Higg MSI. - Freshwater Withdrawals, which is associated to Consumption of Water in this same chapter. As of yet we do not have good enough data to estimate which percentages of water used in the production of our materials and garments come from rain, local water grid or local captation. In 2021 we have started requesting this information be disclosed to us by key tier 2 and 3 suppliers. - Land conversion, which is associated with harvesting and agriculture of raw materials, is not currently being measured due to the complexity of the task as well as lack of complete transparency at tier 4 stage. Risks associated with land conversion are managed by sourcing materials of reputable sources and with third-party certifications where relevant (such as forestry certifications for wood-fibres). Please consult the chapter Sourcing and Use of Raw Materials. Last year we wrote about our data disclosure to GEF Biodiversity in association with Textile Exchange, which aims to uncover and map risks associated with use of materials from the textile industry. This has been further integrated with the data disclosure from Fashion Pact. Whilst the methodology continues to be informed by GEF, no company-specific report of impacts has been made available to date. The CFMB data disclosure by Textile Exchange (which we complete annually) has been aligned with Science Based Targets for Nature for reporting cycle 2023 (pertaining operations for year 2022).",

Our 2021 Supplier Data Gathering included 3 questions on waste and recycling, with direct suppliers on average reporting they are able to send 85% of materials to recycling. A number of suppliers also highlighted that increasing the percentage of materials sent to recycling is often out of their hands, as only some fibres are of value to fabric recyclers – since fabric compositions are decided on by their clients, amount of waste varies according to the fabrics in production. To address waste and pollution caused by the disposal of clothing we take both mitigating and direct action. As mitigating actions, we produce all our garments from high-quality materials and design timeless styles that won’t go out of fashion. We engage our consumers about Care & Repair of clothing to promote longevity of clothing and provide additional trims on request. We operate a take-back scheme across both our brands so that customers can send us clothes they no longer wear, which is a direct action. Our take-back scheme is run from our own team from our warehouse. Garments in exceptionally good condition are given a second clean in our Ozone Chamber, then photographed and listed in our Pre-Loved shops. Garments in good condition but which don’t go into our Pre-Loved shop can be passed on to charity partners who provide clothing to people in need or can sell them in their shops.

    "data": "Mineral Carbonation Highlight: The Path to Net Zero Carbon Nickel 8 Canada Nickel’s Crawford Project is hosted in ultramaﬁc rock, which naturally absorbs and permanently sequesters carbon dioxide (CO2). Canada Nickel has developed the novel IPT Carbonation process which involves injecting a concentrated source of CO2 into tailings generated by the milling process for a brief period of time. This process, called mineral carbonation, ﬁxes CO2 geologically to the tailings while they are still in the processing circuit, rather than afer they have been ﬁnally deposited. In practical terms, this natural advantage provides Canada Nickel the opportunity to capture and store carbon on a large scale while producing critical minerals. Carbon capture test work conducted in early 2023 has demonstrated the potential for Canada Nickel to capture and store approximately one million tonnes of carbon annually. Canada Nickel believes it has the potential to become a hub for a Zero Carbon Industrial Cluster in the Timmins-Cochrane region.",

    "data": "How it Works Mineral carbonation is a naturally occurring process during which carbon dioxide (CO2) reacts with minerals in ultramaﬁc or maﬁc rocks to form stable carbonates, resulting in the capture and permanent storage of CO2. Canada Nickel’s Crawford Project is hosted in ultramaﬁc rock which contains the minerals brucite, serpentine and olivine, all of which have the ability to capture and store CO2 through mineral carbonation. Canada Nickel has been conducting extensive research and development since its inception to harness this property to allow for net zero carbon operation. Geologic deposits that facilitate this reaction are often called carbon sinks, which, in broader terms, are aspects of the natural environmental able to store CO2 from the atmosphere. There are two routes by which this reaction can occur: Passive Carbonation happens when atmospheric CO2 is exposed to a responsive material and reacts to store the CO2 in mineral form. At a mine site like the proposed Crawford Project, this can occur while ore is being handled during the mining and milling processes, or once material has been deposited into a stockpile or the tailings management facility (TMF). Passive carbonation is a relatively slow form of CO2 capture and storage. Active Carbonation is a method of accelerating the otherwise naturally occurring process, often using a concentrated source of CO2. Canada Nickel is undertaking extensive research and development activities to evaluate a proprietary method of active carbonation called In Process Tailings Carbonation (IPT Carbonation).",

    "data": "In Process Tailings Carbonation Canada Nickel has devoted extensive resources to evaluating the potential of IPT Carbonation at the Crawford Project, and beyond. IPT Carbonation is a cost eﬀective, easily integrated modular add on to the process plant, in which tailings, at the end of the processing cycle and prior to deposition in the TMF, are brieﬂy conditioned with concentrated CO2. The injected CO2 reacts with minerals in the tailings (in our case primarily brucite) to form carbonate minerals which stores the CO2 in mineral form within the TMF. Canada Nickel is completing an extensive laboratory test program to understand which process levers can be used to optimize the process in terms of CO2 storage capacity and operational and capital cost. We believe the process enables the potential to store more than 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 when the project is fully ramped up, which would make the project one of the largest CO2 sinks in Ontario. The Company is continuing to work with regulators and partner institutes to evaluate the full potential for carbon sequestration at Crawford, and the opportunities for its application that could extend beyond even our own 20+ regional properties.",
