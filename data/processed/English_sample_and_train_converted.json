This also includes equipping leaders to be inclusive managers with the capability required to foster an open and inclusive environment for their team and our people. In 2021, we refreshed and relaunched our Executive Development Programme (EDP), to align closely with our purpose and values. Each module of the programme focuses on one of our values. Some of the modules build on our existing allyship training to strengthen understanding and reaffirm our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture, while ensuring we all take accountability for diversifying our workplace. This is accompanied by three months of executive coaching and access to insights that give the cohort as detailed a picture of their abilities in different areas as possible.

We’ve augmented the transparency around the EP&L’s data, sharing the results on our open-source platform since 2019 and, starting in 2021, publishing all underlying EKPIs (environmental indicators in their physical unit, not monetized). Our EP&L results for 2021 revealed we had already attained our 40% target to reduce our total environmental impacts four years early, with this trend conﬁrmed once again in the following year.

So, in October 2019, we launched the ﬁrst major survey of its kind to analyze the behavior patterns of more than 3,000 Luxury fashion consumers across France, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, the USA and Japan.

    "data": "Bold ambitions and actions for biodiversity For over a decade, the interface between nature and business has been an important focus for us. We depend on biodiversity for materials like cotton, leather, cashmere and wool to make our Houses’ products and it was important to deepen our understanding of how we impact and depend on it. We’ve been capturing the complexity of land use through our EP&L analysis and it’s our biggest impact after climate, totaling 31% of our Group EP&L. So, making ambitious commitments to protect, restore and regenerate biodiversity was an obvious decision to take; it’s not only essential to be responsible for all our impacts but we’re ensuring supply chain resiliency for the future too. We’ve since moved from commitments and supporting scientiﬁcally-backed frameworks, to having customized programs and clear priorities for addressing biodiversity in, and beyond, our own supply chains. We work with all the main supply chain players, starting from the farming communities themselves, as well as collaborating closely with other sectors linked to fashion’s supply chain, like the food and beauty industries. Our strategically-driven approach is underlined by our biodiversity strategy we published in June 2020. We committed to two main targets: we want to have a net-zero impact on nature by 2025 and to get there we’re regenerating and protecting an area around six times the total land footprint of Kering’s entire supply chain, all the way back to raw material production. Although this part of the supply chain is shared by dozens, if not hundreds, of other companies, we took this entire area of around 350,000 hectares into our calculations. A big part of our approach to biodiversity, and our philosophy as a Group, is to regenerate far more than what we impact. In practical terms, this means we’re working to transform 1 million hectares of farms and landscapes that produce fashion and Luxury’s raw materials to regenerative agriculture, as well as protecting 1 million hectares of critical, irreplaceable habitat outside our supply chain, all by 2025.",

    "data": "Financing mechanisms catalyzing change The transformation of raw material production systems is a top priority for us to help stop and reverse the direct negative impacts that the fashion and Luxury industry has on ecosystems and species. Our biodiversity strategy reﬂects this; it’s built on global expertise and the scientiﬁc consensus that places agriculture as one of the most signiﬁcant drivers of biodiversity loss and climate change. To support our goal to transform 1 million hectares of farms and landscapes to regenerative agriculture in fashion and Luxury’s cotton, wool, cashmere and leather supply chains, we set up an innovative ﬁnancing mechanism with Conservation International in 2021. Our “Regenerative Fund for Nature” aims to scale up regenerative materials for the Luxury and fashion industry by ﬁnancing farmers, NGOs and key stakeholders to move from current agricultural practices, which have high impacts on climate andnature, towards regenerative methods to sequester carbon, mitigate climate change, restore nature, improve localcommunity livelihoods and enhance animal welfare. In September of the same year, we announced the Fund’s ﬁrst seven grantees with projects representing 840,000 hectares across South America, Central Asia, India, Europe and Africa, directly beneﬁting 60,000 people engaged in small and larger scale farming systems. Ultimately these projects will be transformed into regenerative agricultural spaces and we’ve seen good developments within the ﬁrst year; the projects are on track to develop and scale agricultural change on the ground. Consensus in the scientiﬁc community is clear around the need to scale-up ﬁnance and investment in nature-based solutions. We wanted to back this up with action, so we set up another complimentary biodiversity fund mobilizing resources for nature-based solutions in December 2022. Announced during COP15 in Montreal, the “Climate Fund for Nature” is an innovative ﬁnancing mechanism mobilizing resources from the Luxury fashion and beauty sectors; it’s a €300 million fund with €140 million already committed at its launch. In short, the Fund is supporting high-quality projects that contribute to the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems and deliver carbon credits, as well as supporting farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture. The projects will mainly be in the countries where Luxury fashion and beauty source our core raw materials, generating co-beneﬁts for the communities with an emphasis on women. We’re collaborating with Mirova bank to manage the fund and we welcomed the Fund’s ﬁrst partner L’OCCITANE in Montreal. Both the Regenerative Fund for Nature and the Climate Fund for Nature are excellent examples of science-led ﬁnancing mechanisms that are already operational and supporting nature. We’ve opened them both up to other leading companies as our focus is on scaling measurable outcomes for nature, climate and livelihoods.",

During the year, we launched a partnership with London Youth, which supports a network of over 600 community youth organisations and creates thousands of engaging opportunities for young people each year. Fifteen youth centres jointly selected by Burberry and London Youth received donations to ensure their programmes could continue to make a positive impact in some of London’s most deprived communities across key areas, including food provision, access to digital resources and activities to help young people stay connected with others in order to improve their mental wellbeing. The donations helped frontline youth organisations playing a vital role in young people’s lives to continue their services and keep their doors open. Inspired by our work with Marcus Rashford MBE during our festive campaign, the Burberry Foundation deepened the impact of the initial donation by supporting London Youth to respond to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on food, education and mental health support.

That’s why we make every effort to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization and provides our teams with an open-minded, diverse, inclusive and stimulating work environment, thereby contributing to our Group’s success. We pay close attention to diversity in employee proﬁles (gender, culture, origin, sexual orientation, identity, age and disability), which we recognize as a rewarding source of collective intelligence. As part of our sustainability strategy, we promote diversity and gender equality through a series of concrete commitments, which include ensuring gender parity and salary pay equity in all functions and achieving gender parity at all levels. In 2022, women represented 63% of our total workforce, with 57% in management roles in the Group, 33% in our Executive Committee, and 45% in our Board of Directors (excluding Directors representing employees). We’re proud of this representation across every level of our company, making Kering one of the most feminized companies in the CAC 40. Indeed, Kering placed second in the 2022 Reﬁnitiv Diversity & Inclusion index among nearly 12,000 international companies. Kering is also proudly pioneering social innovation, with social standards fostering gender equality. As an example, Baby Leave, launched in January 2020, allows all parents – mothers, fathers and partners – to take 14 weeks of fully-paid leave to care for their child. This contributes to gender equality in a practical way by guaranteeing the same parental leave rights to all parents, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation and personal situation. It also ensures genuine gender equality for all Kering employees and in particular makes an effective contribution to tackling the prejudices women face whenever 63% women in our total workforce in 2022, 57% in management roles 33%, in our Executive Committee 45% in our Board of Directors they apply for a job, seek a promotion or attempt to advance their careers. Our global policy on domestic violence, launched in January 2022, is another example of our advanced social standards. Aligned with the ILO Convention No.190 on violence and harassment, this internal policy was designed to provide the appropriate support to survivors and victims of domestic violence, in line with our belief that businesses have a decisive role to play in combatting violence against women.",

Key measures of success for the programme include cashmere and other livestock production per herder, as well as the price-adjusted income per goat. In addition, other metrics are monitored in relation to improved levels of gender awareness and awareness of improved animal husbandry and cashmere harvesting practices. One aspect of this initiative is a training programme developed to help raise herders’ awareness of cashmere harvesting best practice and herding techniques to enhance their income. Training on sustainable pasture management and responsible farming techniques aims to prevent overgrazing and desertification. This helps to build the awareness communities need to cope with the future impacts of climate change. Through the medium of a radio drama and public service announcements, information is shared to help herding communities improve their livestock management practices and, for goat herders, the quality of their cashmere.

At Kering, we take our role seriously as a ﬁrst mover supporting pioneering solutions and, in fact, we’ve known for some time that 50% of our own reduction targets were relying on innovation.

Psychological safety is driven largely by the behavior of those in positions of power, but all employees play a role. Therefore, we focus on developing leadership skills in managers while recognizing that there also are steps individual contributors can take toward building psychological safety.",

Major cloud providers, like Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, oﬀer certiﬁcation courses and tests for employees to learn and demonstrate understanding of cloud platforms. “We wanted to come up with a way to engage the ﬁrm so that our employees could commit to continual learning,” Rao said. “It was not just to get people certiﬁed, but to also build interest.”The volunteer-based initiative engaged 30 employees who were already certiﬁed in Azure to each train cohorts of up to 50 people. Using a blend of volunteer coaches and Microsoft-provided classes, participants spent 70 to 80 hours over the course of six weeks, all during work hours, to get cloud-certiﬁed. Over the course of six months in 2022, 1,200 people completed certiﬁcation, and about 15% of those people completed Azure training beyond the initial foundations-level certiﬁcation.

At our Immingham plant, we completed an in-depth heat and energy survey, made modiﬁcations to the plant, and installed solar panels to our site oﬃces. In Teesside, we installed a second boiler control panel, delivering both gas and electricity reductions and commenced the installation of a new cooling tower which is expected to be completed in 2023. During the year, to improve the understanding and management of energy for our plants we also installed an energy monitoring system at our Teesside plant. The system provides live energy data and historic trends and we will assess the potential roll out of the system at our other plants. We are also in the process of achieving ISO 50001 accreditation for all three plants, with the initial audit complete and training of the requirements undertaken by the biofuels team.

This is a reduction from 2021 (7.78mt CO2e) as sharp rises in commodity prices aﬀected available liquidity across the market, and saw us supply less volume in 2022. We remain committed and on track to meet our ﬁrst milestone of an 8mt saving by 2030. Shipping of feedstock and product contributed 1.4 mt CO2e to our 2022 scope 3 emissions footprint.

This assessment was undertaken in 2022 and the results have provided the Board and senior management with a more granular understanding of the drivers of climate-related risks. Looking forward, this will be used to inform an ongoing review of the measures required to manage exposure and seize the associated opportunities. Risk and opportunities identiﬁcation and assessment process In the ﬁrst stage of the assessment, Greenergy held internal interviews to understand the eﬀect of climate risks and opportunities in diﬀerent parts of the business. Each identiﬁed transition risk, (including emerging regulatory requirements), physical climate risk, or related opportunity was qualitatively assessed and scored to understand the signiﬁcance onthe Group’s strategic resilience. For risks, a total score was determined as a function of three indicators: vulnerability, likelihood, and magnitude of impact. For opportunities, the total score was determined using two indicators: the size of the opportunity and the business’ ability to execute based on existing strategic alignment and cost to realise the opportunity. Each identiﬁed risk and opportunity were quantitatively assessed, score and ranks to understand the comparative signiﬁcance to the business.This scoring was repeated for each climate scenario and time horizons considered (see pages 24 to 28 formore information) Risk controls Greenergy incorporates climate factors into its risk management, and has taken action to avoid, mitigate and adapt to physical and transition risks. Operational and major incident hazards, including those aggravated by climate change such as ﬂooding or extreme temperatures, are identiﬁed, monitored and managed at site level, with support from the Process Integrity and Business Continuity Plan team. Flooding is one of the main hazards faced by many of our terminals and plants which are coastal orriverside. The risks and associated mitigations are outlined and managed in our risk register.

A broad energy mix is needed to improve living conditions and feed 8 billion people around the world. Energy systems are fundamental to the products used by people everyday and power industries, generate electricity, provide heat for homes, and fuel the transport of goods and people. To respond to this challenge, energy systems are undergoing a transition. We believe that oil and natural gas production will continue for decades to come and will be instrumental in the energy transition. Oil and gas are abundant, energy dense, and easy-to-transport resources.

    "data": "PERFORMANCE DRIVENBY COMMITMENT Our business model proved its value once again by delivering record results in 2022. That model, which we pursue all over the world, is based on the desirability of our products and our mission,“The Art of Crafting Dreams”. But our success is only worth while if it is also virtuous. Success can only last if it is fair. And ifit benefits everyone, then it will be even greater. What’s the point of inspiring dreams with magnifi-cent products if they don’t meet the highest social and environmental standards? We apply those standards for the benefit of our employees and our customers of course, for our stakeholders as well, but above all for our future. This involves considering the common good in everything we do, and ensur-ing that the benefit of our success extends beyond our own sphere.Our success is the result of the amazing work done by our 200,000 people in the last few years, during which we have overcome numerous crises. It’s our duty to offer them a fair and stimulat-ing working environment in which they can fulfill their talent. That’s why, in 2022, we brought together the diversity and inclusion efforts of the Group, our Maisons and our regions to form a bold roadmap.This is especially important given that the Group welcomes thousands of new employees every year, including 39,000 early career professionals in 2022. We must pass on our unique skills and know-how to those young people, particularly in the areas of cre-ative, craft and customer experience. In 2022, for the first time, we traveled around France to meet this new generation, introducing them to the Métiers d’Excellence LVMH – professions in which our virtu-osos ensure the excellence of our products – and inspiring them to take those professions up. It is also our duty to change the way we represent beauty, to form a closer link between desirability and sustainability. This is what LVMH’s environmental commitment is all about: using our influence to protect nature and all living things. Our whole Group has put its weight behind this effort, as shown by the results of our LIFE 360 program and our energy sobriety plan to cut energy consumption by 10% between October 2022 and October 2023. We stepped up our biodiversity initiatives last year and presented them during COP 15. For example, we cooperated more closely with UNESCO on pro-jects aimed at minimizing the consequences of cli-mate change on biodiversity and improving the resilience of ecosystems. We are also expanding our innovative research efforts – in areas like agrofor-estry, the conversion of keratin into fibers, recycling and upcycling – to achieve creative circularity. Sustainability is crucial to our ongoing progress. Our triple A rating from the CDP – covering water, biodi-versity and the climate – sends a strong signal, while also encouraging us to go further. Finally, all around the world, it is our duty to share our passion for culture, and our efforts to fulfill that duty are spearheaded by the Fondation Louis Vuitton and its extraordinary exhibitions. In 2022, the Morozov Collection, the Simon Hantaï Retrospective and the Monet-Mitchell Dialogue were seen by millions of visitors from France and abroad. By creating exceptional products using outstanding environmental and social practices, and by sharing unforgettable works of art and introduc-ing them to a new audience, we fulfill LVMH’s voca-tion: letting our culture shine forth and inspiring dreams among people all over the world.",

Creating synergies between our Houses makes a big difference here too; we’ve focused on streamlining any potential unsold goods or damaged items that might happen during manufacturing or client returns. This also proves helpful so that we can reintroduce the materials into our supply chain after dismantling items, to keep them circulating in brand new products. To optimize our coordinated efforts, in 2020, we created a centralized dashboard at Group level to track stock levels across all our Houses. Using data analysis, we monitor if there is any unsold stock from each Houseand where it is in the world.

Using forensic science and statistical analysis, the ﬁber’s naturally-occurring chemical properties are analyzed, creating a unique chemical ﬁngerprint to link it back to the ﬁeld where the cotton is grown. This means that at every step of the supply chain, the organic cotton is veriﬁed to ensure the raw material, fabric and ﬁnal product matches with the original ﬁngerprint. Only an exact match guarantees authenticity, ensuring that substitution, blending or tampering do not occur along the way. For us, this provides excellent visibility so that we can verify farming best practices and ﬁber quality; ensure integrity within our organic cotton supply chain; and guarantee alignment with our Kering Standards. Since launching, we’ve increased our sourcing countries in Oritain’s database to improve consistency and veriﬁcation, testing hundreds of cotton samples from 13 countries.

    "data": "Methane Regulations In 2018, Environment and Climate Change Canada set in place federal regulations for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector which came into force January 1, 2020. These regulations are set to achieve a methane reduction from upstream oil and gas facilities of 40–45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. The Provinces take responsibility for energy and natural resources within their boundaries and have bodies to govern these activities. The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have developed GHG emissions reduction programs of their own, that have achieved equivalency under the federal regulations. These programs have increasing regulatory stringency in subsequent years and, if speciﬁed climate-related outcomes are not met, additional regulations could come into force. The government of Canada has committed to expanding its oil and gas methane emissions reduction target to at least a 75 per cent reduction below 2012 levels by 2030. In November 2022, a proposed federal regulatory framework for the oil and gas sector was released to achieve the 2030 target. Tightening methane regulations in future years may require retroﬁtting existing sites, equipment upgrades, GHG reduction project planning, capital investment, air monitoring, and other reporting requirements. Additional future costs will be associated with equipment, projects, monitoring, and reporting. Methane has been the focus of our GHG emissions reduction efforts for the last ﬁve years and we have achieved an impressive 84 percent reduction of our methane emissions during that time period (Figure 5). We continue to monitor ongoing developments and proposed regulations to ensure regulatory compliance can be achieved. Emissions from methane Emissions from methane are measured in tonnes of CO₂ equivalent.\nIn 2018, Baytex emitted 2,096,430 tonnes CO₂ from methane.\nBy 2022, emissions were reduced to 334,553 tonnes CO₂.\nThis represents an 84% reduction in methane emissions since 2018.",
