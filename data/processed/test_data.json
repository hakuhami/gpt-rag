    "data": "Financing mechanisms catalyzing change The transformation of raw material production systems is a top priority for us to help stop and reverse the direct negative impacts that the fashion and Luxury industry has on ecosystems and species. Our biodiversity strategy reﬂects this; it’s built on global expertise and the scientiﬁc consensus that places agriculture as one of the most signiﬁcant drivers of biodiversity loss and climate change. To support our goal to transform 1 million hectares of farms and landscapes to regenerative agriculture in fashion and Luxury’s cotton, wool, cashmere and leather supply chains, we set up an innovative ﬁnancing mechanism with Conservation International in 2021. Our “Regenerative Fund for Nature” aims to scale up regenerative materials for the Luxury and fashion industry by ﬁnancing farmers, NGOs and key stakeholders to move from current agricultural practices, which have high impacts on climate andnature, towards regenerative methods to sequester carbon, mitigate climate change, restore nature, improve localcommunity livelihoods and enhance animal welfare. In September of the same year, we announced the Fund’s ﬁrst seven grantees with projects representing 840,000 hectares across South America, Central Asia, India, Europe and Africa, directly beneﬁting 60,000 people engaged in small and larger scale farming systems. Ultimately these projects will be transformed into regenerative agricultural spaces and we’ve seen good developments within the ﬁrst year; the projects are on track to develop and scale agricultural change on the ground. Consensus in the scientiﬁc community is clear around the need to scale-up ﬁnance and investment in nature-based solutions. We wanted to back this up with action, so we set up another complimentary biodiversity fund mobilizing resources for nature-based solutions in December 2022. Announced during COP15 in Montreal, the “Climate Fund for Nature” is an innovative ﬁnancing mechanism mobilizing resources from the Luxury fashion and beauty sectors; it’s a €300 million fund with €140 million already committed at its launch. In short, the Fund is supporting high-quality projects that contribute to the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems and deliver carbon credits, as well as supporting farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture. The projects will mainly be in the countries where Luxury fashion and beauty source our core raw materials, generating co-beneﬁts for the communities with an emphasis on women. We’re collaborating with Mirova bank to manage the fund and we welcomed the Fund’s ﬁrst partner L’OCCITANE in Montreal. Both the Regenerative Fund for Nature and the Climate Fund for Nature are excellent examples of science-led ﬁnancing mechanisms that are already operational and supporting nature.

We depend on biodiversity for materials like cotton, leather, cashmere and wool to make our Houses’ products and it was important to deepen our understanding of how we impact and depend on it. We’ve been capturing the complexity of land use through our EP&L analysis and it’s our biggest impact after climate, totaling 31% of our Group EP&L. So, making ambitious commitments to protect, restore and regenerate biodiversity was an obvious decision to take; it’s not only essential to be responsible for all our impacts but we’re ensuring supply chain resiliency for the future too. We’ve since moved from commitments and supporting scientiﬁcally-backed frameworks, to having customized programs and clear priorities for addressing biodiversity in, and beyond, our own supply chains. We work with all the main supply chain players, starting from the farming communities themselves, as well as collaborating closely with other sectors linked to fashion’s supply chain, like the food and beauty industries. Our strategically-driven approach is underlined by our biodiversity strategy we published in June 2020. We committed to two main targets: we want to have a net-zero impact on nature by 2025 and to get there we’re regenerating and protecting an area around six times the total land footprint of Kering’s entire supply chain, all the way back to raw material production. Although this part of the supply chain is shared by dozens, if not hundreds, of other companies, we took this entire area of around 350,000 hectares into our calculations. A big part of our approach to biodiversity, and our philosophy as a Group, is to regenerate far more than what we impact. In practical terms, this means we’re working to transform 1 million hectares of farms and landscapes that produce fashion and Luxury’s raw materials to regenerative agriculture, as well as protecting 1 million hectares of critical, irreplaceable habitat outside our supply chain, all by 2025.",
