Details of our inclusive hiring approach, Diversity and Inclusion strategy and development programmes can be found on pages 69 to 72. Burberry works with two partner organisations to help make our sites, policies and processes more inclusive of people with both visible and invisible disabilities. We are the first luxury company to partner with the Business Disability Forum, a non-profit member organisation bringing businesses, people with disabilities and policy makers together to help make a difference. In addition, we are among the first luxury companies to join the Valuable 500, the largest network of global CEOs committed to disability inclusion in business, encompassing 55 different sectors and over 12 million colleagues.

The shift to virtual volunteering allowed our people to harness their professional skills to aid our charity partners from home. The type of virtual activities delivered include content creation and live events for youth engagement programmes, digital mentoring, team fund raising events, career coaching and skills-based support sessions for charity partners. During the year, we launched a partnership with London Youth, which supports a network of over 600 community youth organisations and creates thousands of engaging opportunities for young people each year. Fifteen youth centres jointly selected by Burberry and London Youth received donations to ensure their programmes could continue to make a positive impact in some of London’s most deprived communities across key areas, including food provision, access to digital resources and activities to help young people stay connected with others in order to improve their mental wellbeing. The donations helped frontline youth organisations playing a vital role in young people’s lives to continue their services and keep their doors open. Inspired by our work with Marcus Rashford MBE during our festive campaign, the Burberry Foundation deepened the impact of the initial donation by supporting London Youth to respond to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on food, education and mental health support. In addition to fulfilling our strategic goals, we regularly review the effectiveness of our programmes, ensuring the initiatives we develop are impactful and provide the best resources and support.

    "data": "Empowering women, empowering diversity Going further than our commitment to social responsibility, our Group believes that inclusion and diversity are sources of creativity and innovation, and thus of economic performance. That’s why we make every effort to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization and provides our teams with an open-minded, diverse, inclusive and stimulating work environment, thereby contributing to our Group’s success. We pay close attention to diversity in employee proﬁles (gender, culture, origin, sexual orientation, identity, age and disability), which we recognize as a rewarding source of collective intelligence. As part of our sustainability strategy, we promote diversity and gender equality through a series of concrete commitments, which include ensuring gender parity and salary pay equity in all functions and achieving gender parity at all levels. In 2022, women represented 63% of our total workforce, with 57% in management roles in the Group, 33% in our Executive Committee, and 45% in our Board of Directors (excluding Directors representing employees). We’re proud of this representation across every level of our company, making Kering one of the most feminized companies in the CAC 40. Indeed, Kering placed second in the 2022 Reﬁnitiv Diversity & Inclusion index among nearly 12,000 international companies. Kering is also proudly pioneering social innovation, with social standards fostering gender equality. As an example, Baby Leave, launched in January 2020, allows all parents – mothers, fathers and partners – to take 14 weeks of fully-paid leave to care for their child. This contributes to gender equality in a practical way by guaranteeing the same parental leave rights to all parents, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation and personal situation. It also ensures genuine gender equality for all Kering employees and in particular makes an effective contribution to tackling the prejudices women face whenever 63% women in our total workforce in 2022, 57% in management roles 33%, in our Executive Committee 45% in our Board of Directors they apply for a job, seek a promotion or attempt to advance their careers. Our global policy on domestic violence, launched in January 2022, is another example of our advanced social standards. Aligned with the ILO Convention No.190 on violence and harassment, this internal policy was designed to provide the appropriate support to survivors and victims of domestic violence, in line with our belief that businesses have a decisive role to play in combatting violence against women.",
