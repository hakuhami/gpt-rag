The shift to virtual volunteering allowed our people to harness their professional skills to aid our charity partners from home. The type of virtual activities delivered include content creation and live events for youth engagement programmes, digital mentoring, team fund raising events, career coaching and skills-based support sessions for charity partners. During the year, we launched a partnership with London Youth, which supports a network of over 600 community youth organisations and creates thousands of engaging opportunities for young people each year. Fifteen youth centres jointly selected by Burberry and London Youth received donations to ensure their programmes could continue to make a positive impact in some of London’s most deprived communities across key areas, including food provision, access to digital resources and activities to help young people stay connected with others in order to improve their mental wellbeing. The donations helped frontline youth organisations playing a vital role in young people’s lives to continue their services and keep their doors open. Inspired by our work with Marcus Rashford MBE during our festive campaign, the Burberry Foundation deepened the impact of the initial donation by supporting London Youth to respond to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on food, education and mental health support. In addition to fulfilling our strategic goals, we regularly review the effectiveness of our programmes, ensuring the initiatives we develop are impactful and provide the best resources and support.

That’s why we make every effort to establish a culture of equality at all levels of the organization and provides our teams with an open-minded, diverse, inclusive and stimulating work environment, thereby contributing to our Group’s success. We pay close attention to diversity in employee proﬁles (gender, culture, origin, sexual orientation, identity, age and disability), which we recognize as a rewarding source of collective intelligence. As part of our sustainability strategy, we promote diversity and gender equality through a series of concrete commitments, which include ensuring gender parity and salary pay equity in all functions and achieving gender parity at all levels. In 2022, women represented 63% of our total workforce, with 57% in management roles in the Group, 33% in our Executive Committee, and 45% in our Board of Directors (excluding Directors representing employees). We’re proud of this representation across every level of our company, making Kering one of the most feminized companies in the CAC 40. Indeed, Kering placed second in the 2022 Reﬁnitiv Diversity & Inclusion index among nearly 12,000 international companies. Kering is also proudly pioneering social innovation, with social standards fostering gender equality. As an example, Baby Leave, launched in January 2020, allows all parents – mothers, fathers and partners – to take 14 weeks of fully-paid leave to care for their child. This contributes to gender equality in a practical way by guaranteeing the same parental leave rights to all parents, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation and personal situation. It also ensures genuine gender equality for all Kering employees and in particular makes an effective contribution to tackling the prejudices women face whenever 63% women in our total workforce in 2022, 57% in management roles 33%, in our Executive Committee 45% in our Board of Directors they apply for a job, seek a promotion or attempt to advance their careers. Our global policy on domestic violence, launched in January 2022, is another example of our advanced social standards. Aligned with the ILO Convention No.190 on violence and harassment, this internal policy was designed to provide the appropriate support to survivors and victims of domestic violence, in line with our belief that businesses have a decisive role to play in combatting violence against women.",

Over the last three years these audits totaled 9,937. To further amplify our Code of Ethics and Suppliers’ Charter, in 2021, we published the Group’s Human Rights Policy covering all of our Group’s operations and supply chain, across four key pillars. Here, we’re collaborating with a wide variety of stakeholders; from our peers with similar goals, to international organizations and experts on the subject.

The Fashion Pact, originally established by Kering in 2019, includes 250 brands, representing more than a third in production volume of the textile and fashion industry, working towards three pillars: Climate, Oceans and Biodiversity. By the end of 2022, more than 14 collective projects were in play. The Fashion Pact announced its ﬁrst major project in 2022, with the CEOs of 12 member companies, including Kering, committing to generate 100,000 MWh of solar energy every year to feed it into the grid. By increasing the availability of renewable energy for purchase, the “Collective Virtual Power Purchasing Agreement” will reduce emissions for the entire sector over the long term. In 2021, we replicated the successful Fashion Pact model for the watches and jewellery sector and launched the “Watch & Jewellery Initiative 2030” with Cartier.

Launched in FY 2017/18, the programme, developed in partnership between The Burberry Foundation, Oxfam and PUR Projet, aims to improve the livelihoods of Afghan cashmere herding communities by helping them to develop a more sustainable and inclusive cashmere industry in the country. Key measures of success for the programme include cashmere and other livestock production per herder, as well as the price-adjusted income per goat. In addition, other metrics are monitored in relation to improved levels of gender awareness and awareness of improved animal husbandry and cashmere harvesting practices. One aspect of this initiative is a training programme developed to help raise herders’ awareness of cashmere harvesting best practice and herding techniques to enhance their income. Training on sustainable pasture management and responsible farming techniques aims to prevent overgrazing and desertification. This helps to build the awareness communities need to cope with the future impacts of climate change. Through the medium of a radio drama and public service announcements, information is shared to help herding communities improve their livestock management practices and, for goat herders, the quality of their cashmere.

At Kering, we take our role seriously as a ﬁrst mover supporting pioneering solutions and, in fact, we’ve known for some time that 50% of our own reduction targets were relying on innovation. So, we’ve continued to create initiatives and invest in promising startups, piloting new technological solutions.

Financial institutions are uniquely positioned to address the issue because traﬃckers typically use banks to manage, transfer and launder their revenue. The U.S. Bancorp Enterprise Financial Crimes Compliance (EFCC) unit has joined with law enforcement and non proﬁts to proactively track and report suspicious transactions that might be related to human traﬃcking. For example, EFCC joined with Knoble Human Traﬃcking Project to identify human traﬃcking activity during the Super Bowl. Another initiative investigated traﬃcking in Ukraine. EFCC focused on merchants, usually aligned with transportation, that had high-value transactions and used Ukraine-based credit cards.",

We decided to use co-learning – depending on internal volunteer coaches. Madhu Rao, senior vice president and head of enterprise and solutions architecture who designed the program, said he didn’t want employees to feel nervous about learning cloud technology. Major cloud providers, like Azure, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, oﬀer certiﬁcation courses and tests for employees to learn and demonstrate understanding of cloud platforms. “We wanted to come up with a way to engage the ﬁrm so that our employees could commit to continual learning,” Rao said. “It was not just to get people certiﬁed, but to also build interest.”The volunteer-based initiative engaged 30 employees who were already certiﬁed in Azure to each train cohorts of up to 50 people. Using a blend of volunteer coaches and Microsoft-provided classes, participants spent 70 to 80 hours over the course of six weeks, all during work hours, to get cloud-certiﬁed. Over the course of six months in 2022, 1,200 people completed certiﬁcation, and about 15% of those people completed Azure training beyond the initial foundations-level certiﬁcation.

Our two UK plants have run on renewable electricity since late 2020 and in 2022, our Amsterdam plant switched to a green tariﬀf or electricity and gas. As our plants have transitioned onto renewable energy, emissions from our renewables production business decreased in 2022, totalling 42.7k mt CO2e (2021:54.6k mt CO2e). Regular maintenance schedules and continued investment in our plants keeps them in optimal condition, allowing us to operate them as eﬃciently as possible and increase output to meet growing demand. Following the energy saving measures introduced at the Amsterdam plant in 2021, we have begun to replicate the learnings at our UK plants. At our Immingham plant, we completed an in-depth heat and energy survey, made modiﬁcations to the plant, and installed solar panels to our site oﬃces. In Teesside, we installed a second boiler control panel, delivering both gas and electricity reductions and commenced the installation of a new cooling tower which is expected to be completed in 2023. During the year, to improve the understanding and management of energy for our plants we also installed an energy monitoring system at our Teesside plant. The system provides live energy data and historic trends and we will assess the potential roll out of the system at our other plants. We are also in the process of achieving ISO 50001 accreditation for all three plants, with the initial audit complete and training of the requirements undertaken by the biofuels team. We will continue to progress throughout 2023.",

In line with our strategic commitment to supply low-carbon fuels and circular solutions, we have an ambition of helping our customers avoid 8m tCO2e by 2030, and 12m tCO2e by 2035 with our products. This year we helped our customers save 7.1 million tonnes of CO2e compared with using the fossil fuel equivalent. This is a reduction from 2021 (7.78mt CO2e) as sharp rises in commodity prices aﬀected available liquidity across the market, and saw us supply less volume in 2022. We remain committed and on track to meet our ﬁrst milestone of an 8mt saving by 2030. Shipping of feedstock and product contributed 1.4 mt CO2e to our 2022 scope 3 emissions footprint.

This assessment was undertaken in 2022 and the results have provided the Board and senior management with a more granular understanding of the drivers of climate-related risks. Looking forward, this will be used to inform an ongoing review of the measures required to manage exposure and seize the associated opportunities. Risk and opportunities identiﬁcation and assessment process In the ﬁrst stage of the assessment, Greenergy held internal interviews to understand the eﬀect of climate risks and opportunities in diﬀerent parts of the business. Each identiﬁed transition risk, (including emerging regulatory requirements), physical climate risk, or related opportunity was qualitatively assessed and scored to understand the signiﬁcance onthe Group’s strategic resilience. For risks, a total score was determined as a function of three indicators: vulnerability, likelihood, and magnitude of impact. For opportunities, the total score was determined using two indicators: the size of the opportunity and the business’ ability to execute based on existing strategic alignment and cost to realise the opportunity. Each identiﬁed risk and opportunity were quantitatively assessed, score and ranks to understand the comparative signiﬁcance to the business.This scoring was repeated for each climate scenario and time horizons considered (see pages 24 to 28 formore information) Risk controls Greenergy incorporates climate factors into its risk management, and has taken action to avoid, mitigate and adapt to physical and transition risks. Operational and major incident hazards, including those aggravated by climate change such as ﬂooding or extreme temperatures, are identiﬁed, monitored and managed at site level, with support from the Process Integrity and Business Continuity Plan team. Flooding is one of the main hazards faced by many of our terminals and plants which are coastal orriverside. The risks and associated mitigations are outlined and managed in our risk register. The Group has also responded to transition risks, such as the adoption of an internal carbon price. This was reviewed in 2022, and set at £80 per tonne/CO2e to reﬂect recent increases with the UK ETS cost. The carbon price has been incorporated into investment calculations and large capital decisions, and the Group is deﬁning relevant metrics to drive its commitment to prioritise growth capital on projects that reduce emissions intensity.",

Our climate impact assessment has provided a more granular understanding of risks and subsequently increased the comparative importance of climate change as a principal risk. Greenergy monitors its performance across a range of absolute and intensity environmental indicators, which keeps the Group informed of and accountable for its environmental impact. We measure operational (scope 1and 2) GHG emissions as well as emissions from scope 3 relating to indirect emissions from business travel, waste and water for all UK plants, terminals and oﬃces and other environmental metrics related to avoided emissions, water, energy, renewables, waste, and fuel-speciﬁc intensity metrics. In 2022, the Group prioritised the development of a more comprehensive scope 3 inventory (see page 19) and it is our intention to disclose all material scope 3 emission categories, including those relatedto emissions from the use of ourproducts, alongside the adoptionof the requirements for of theTCFD in 2023.Greenergy has committed toachieving net zero by 2050 orsooner, and to attaining carbon neutrality of operational (scope1 and 2) emissions by 2035, with an interim target to reduce gross emissions by 50% by 2030 against our 2020 baseline. In line with our strategic commitment to supply low-carbon fuels and circular solutions, we have a target of helping our customers avoid 8m tCO2e by 2030, and 12m tCO2e by 2035, with our products, which we are on track to achieve The Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is currently developing a new methodology for oil and gas companies to set science-based targets.

Energy systems are fundamental to the products used by people everyday and power industries, generate electricity, provide heat for homes, and fuel the transport of goods and people. To respond to this challenge, energy systems are undergoing a transition. We believe that oil and natural gas production will continue for decades to come and will be instrumental in the energy transition. Oil and gas are abundant, energy dense, and easy-to-transport resources.

Our goal is toreverse this trend by focusing on our asset integrity program and increasing data visibility.\nReportable Spills\nIn 2018, there were 15 reportable spills, with a total spills volume of 144 cubic meters from non-trucking sources and 11 cubic meters from trucking.\nThe number of reportable spills peaked at 23 in 2019, with non-trucking spill volumes reaching 239 cubic meters and trucking spill volumes recorded at 0 cubic meters.\nIn 2020, reportable spills decreased significantly to 9, with non-trucking spill volumes dropping to 140 cubic meters and no trucking spills reported.\n2021 saw an increase in reportable spills to 17, with a total spills volume of 202 cubic meters from non-trucking sources and 0 cubic meters from trucking.\nThe year 2022 recorded 18 reportable spills, the highest spills volume in the period at 312 cubic meters from non-trucking sources, with 0.8 cubic meters from trucking.\nWe continue to identify areas of improvement to prevent spills fromoccurring as our spill volumes continue to increase over the last three years.The largest contributor to our spills in 2022 was a spill of 160 m3 of released brine due to corrosion stemming from a breakdown of interior coating in oneof our pipelines in Saskatchewan. We continue to investigate technologyand material options to track and control pipeline leaks.\nPipeline Spills Rate\nIn 2018, Baytex had a pipeline spills rate of 0.57 incidents per 1,000 operating pipelines, while peers reported a higher rate of 1.18 incidents.\nThe rate of pipeline spills for Baytex increased to 1.58 incidents per 1,000 operating pipelines in 2019, with peers reporting an even higher rate of 1.91 incidents.\nBaytex saw a decrease in its pipeline spills rate to 1.29 incidents per 1,000 operating pipelines in 2020, while peers' rate also decreased to 1.41 incidents.\nIn 2021, Baytex's pipeline spills rate rose again to 1.72 incidents per 1,000 operating pipelines, matching the rate of its peers at 1.72 incidents.\nBy 2022, Baytex reduced its pipeline spills rate significantly to 0.70 incidents per 1,000 operating pipelines, while the peers' rate remained stable at 1.72 incidents.\nBaytex’s pipeline-related spills has historically been below peer average. (1)2022 peer average data was unavailable at the time of publication.\nIn 2022, we conducted 39 aerial inspections on 263 pipelines(covering more than 7,100 km in total) and completed 175 km ofin-line inspections.We inspected 100% of water crossings in our high-risk areas —ranking in the top 6% of peer industries, including oil and gas,industrial, forestry, and municipalities.",

As of December 2022, we have restored 22 hectares of land in caribou and grizzly bear wildlife zones.The Chinchaga Located in northwestern Alberta, the Chinchaga region comprises more than three million acres of Alberta’s boreal forests and is home to diverse vegetation and wildlife. The Chinchaga region is covered by the province’s Caribou Protection Plan, including speciﬁc regulations for companies operating in the region to protect the local woodland caribou population and reclaim the area following operations.The site Our restored assets include ﬁve wells, two remote sumps previously used to store generated waste, and associated access roads in the area. Reclamation progress Our sites in the Chinchaga can only be accessed by ice road during winter months making reclamation activities in the region more challenging than in other areas. To increase the pace of our reclamation activities, we applied for and received funding through the Alberta government’s Site Rehabilitation Program to support environmental site assessments and remediation and reclamation activities in designated wildlife zones.

We also became the ﬁrst corporate partner with the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) starting in 2019, contributing to its global policy work and breadth of research, including a focus on the impact and dependenceof business on biodiversity. These scientiﬁc frameworks are critical to inform international regulations, governance andreporting requirements and, in turn, drive meaningful action. Here, we’ve supported the Science Based Target Network too in the development of the science-based target for nature as a member of its corporate engagement program and we plan to roll out the guidance on a Group level when it’s published in March 2023. We’re also members of the Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, providing input into its methodology and similarly, we will incorporatethe recommendations into our strategy and reporting. Working alongside other companies on collective issues has also proved insightful; we’ve been an active sponsor of One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) since its founding in 2019. As a business coalition, OP2B brings together companies across different sectors that share similaragricultural supply chains and impacts on biodiversity, including fashion, food and beauty brands. Through collective research, action, and advocacy, the coalition aimsto catalyze increased conservation and ecosystem restoration efforts, and wide-spread adoption of regenerative agriculture.

        "data": "PERFORMANCE DRIVENBY COMMITMENT Our business model proved its value once again by delivering record results in 2022. That model, which we pursue all over the world, is based on the desirability of our products and our mission,“The Art of Crafting Dreams”. But our success is only worth while if it is also virtuous. Success can only last if it is fair. And ifit benefits everyone, then it will be even greater. What’s the point of inspiring dreams with magnifi-cent products if they don’t meet the highest social and environmental standards? We apply those standards for the benefit of our employees and our customers of course, for our stakeholders as well, but above all for our future. This involves considering the common good in everything we do, and ensur-ing that the benefit of our success extends beyond our own sphere.Our success is the result of the amazing work done by our 200,000 people in the last few years, during which we have overcome numerous crises. It’s our duty to offer them a fair and stimulat-ing working environment in which they can fulfill their talent. That’s why, in 2022, we brought together the diversity and inclusion efforts of the Group, our Maisons and our regions to form a bold roadmap.This is especially important given that the Group welcomes thousands of new employees every year, including 39,000 early career professionals in 2022. We must pass on our unique skills and know-how to those young people, particularly in the areas of cre-ative, craft and customer experience. In 2022, for the first time, we traveled around France to meet this new generation, introducing them to the Métiers d’Excellence LVMH – professions in which our virtu-osos ensure the excellence of our products – and inspiring them to take those professions up. It is also our duty to change the way we represent beauty, to form a closer link between desirability and sustainability. This is what LVMH’s environmental commitment is all about: using our influence to protect nature and all living things. Our whole Group has put its weight behind this effort, as shown by the results of our LIFE 360 program and our energy sobriety plan to cut energy consumption by 10% between October 2022 and October 2023. We stepped up our biodiversity initiatives last year and presented them during COP 15. For example, we cooperated more closely with UNESCO on pro-jects aimed at minimizing the consequences of cli-mate change on biodiversity and improving the resilience of ecosystems. We are also expanding our innovative research efforts – in areas like agrofor-estry, the conversion of keratin into fibers, recycling and upcycling – to achieve creative circularity. Sustainability is crucial to our ongoing progress. Our triple A rating from the CDP – covering water, biodi-versity and the climate – sends a strong signal, while also encouraging us to go further.

Using forensic science and statistical analysis, the ﬁber’s naturally-occurring chemical properties are analyzed, creating a unique chemical ﬁngerprint to link it back to the ﬁeld where the cotton is grown. This means that at every step of the supply chain, the organic cotton is veriﬁed to ensure the raw material, fabric and ﬁnal product matches with the original ﬁngerprint. Only an exact match guarantees authenticity, ensuring that substitution, blending or tampering do not occur along the way. For us, this provides excellent visibility so that we can verify farming best practices and ﬁber quality; ensure integrity within our organic cotton supply chain; and guarantee alignment with our Kering Standards. Since launching, we’ve increased our sourcing countries in Oritain’s database to improve consistency and veriﬁcation, testing hundreds of cotton samples from 13 countries.

The Actestablished a federal benchmark carbon pollution pricingsystem applied to fuel and combustible waste. The enactedfederal carbon pricing impacts provincial jurisdictions thatdo not have an equivalent Output-Based Pricing Systemin place. The Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta,where Baytex operates, have performance standardsin place which determine our ﬁnancial exposure to thefederal fuel tax. Both provinces have obtained and mustmaintain federal equivalency for their programs. Theseprovincial programs have associated compliance costswhen performance standards, relative to an emissionsbenchmark, cannot be fully met. Compliance costs differby province depending on the performance standardrequirement and compliance cost rate. Emissions coverageincludes stationary combustion from the implementationof the performance standards and expanding coverage tostationary combustion and ﬂaring emissions in 2023.Carbon pricing in Canada increased from $50 per tonneof CO2 e (tCO2 e) in 2022 to $65 per tCO2 e in 2023, and willcontinue to increase $15 per tCO2 e annually to $170 pertCO2 e in 2030. There are direct costs of compliance fees inperformance standards, as well as inﬂationary inﬂuences onthe cost of services and products as carbon pricing increasesfuel costs for service providers.

        "data": "Methane Regulations In 2018, Environment and Climate Change Canada set in place federal regulations for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector which came into force January 1, 2020. These regulations are set to achieve a methane reduction from upstream oil and gas facilities of 40–45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. The Provinces take responsibility for energy and natural resources within their boundaries and have bodies to govern these activities. The Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have developed GHG emissions reduction programs of their own, that have achieved equivalency under the federal regulations. These programs have increasing regulatory stringency in subsequent years and, if speciﬁed climate-related outcomes are not met, additional regulations could come into force. The government of Canada has committed to expanding its oil and gas methane emissions reduction target to at least a 75 per cent reduction below 2012 levels by 2030. In November 2022, a proposed federal regulatory framework for the oil and gas sector was released to achieve the 2030 target. Tightening methane regulations in future years may require retroﬁtting existing sites, equipment upgrades, GHG reduction project planning, capital investment, air monitoring, and other reporting requirements. Additional future costs will be associated with equipment, projects, monitoring, and reporting. Methane has been the focus of our GHG emissions reduction efforts for the last ﬁve years and we have achieved an impressive 84 percent reduction of our methane emissions during that time period (Figure 5). We continue to monitor ongoing developments and proposed regulations to ensure regulatory compliance can be achieved. Emissions from methane Emissions from methane are measured in tonnes of CO₂ equivalent.\nIn 2018, Baytex emitted 2,096,430 tonnes CO₂ from methane.\nBy 2022, emissions were reduced to 334,553 tonnes CO₂.\nThis represents an 84% reduction in methane emissions since 2018.",
