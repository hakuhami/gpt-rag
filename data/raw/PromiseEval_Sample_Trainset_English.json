The Group believes that having a disability is no barrier to working in the luxury goods industry, and recog-nizes the important contribution that employees with disabilities make to LVMH’s excellence. The Group is a member of the International Labour Organization’s Global Business and Disability Network and has signed its Charter. In 2021, LVMH announced its aim of increasing the proportion of people with disabilities in its global workforce to 2% by 2025. At the end of 2022, that target was supplemented with a commitment to making the Group and Maisons’ websites more accessible. In China in 2022, Louis Vuitton recruited 30 people with disabilities to strengthen its product customization teams. In France in 2011, to help certain employees with disabilities to stay in work, Moët & Chandon cre-ated a disability-friendly company called MHEA. The employees concerned can continue working while benefiting from working conditions that suit their needs.",

Over FY 2020/21, engagement levels have remained high, with scores matching pre-pandemic levels. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how real-time responses to feedback could have an immediate impact on wellbeing.

We are including diversity data monitoring forms in candidate applications. Disclosure is on a voluntary basis and data is treated as confidential. As of January 2021, all members of our Talent Acquisition team had completed unconscious bias in recruitment training. We have committed to rolling out additional training for all hiring managers in 2021.

It’s a way to keep our stakeholders informed and hold ourselves fully accountable. To help us, we pioneered Environmental Proﬁt and Loss (EP&L) accounting back in 2012. A truly innovative tool at the time, and still today, we’ve continued to evolve our EP&L methodology to have a deeper breadth and scope of our environmental impact performance, to identify priorities for action, and to showcase our progress. It not only captures our impacts covering greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste, air and water pollution, and land use across our Group’s direct and indirect activities every year, starting from raw material production where our Houses’ products begin their lives, we now understand the impacts associated with our clients’ use and disposal of them too. We’ve augmented the transparency around the EP&L’s data, sharing the results on our open-source platform since 2019 and, starting in 2021, publishing all underlying EKPIs (environmental indicators in their physical unit, not monetized). Our EP&L results for 2021 revealed we had already attained our 40% target to reduce our total environmental impacts four years early, with this trend conﬁrmed once again in the following year. For 2022, we reduced the Group’s absolute emissions in scopes 1 and 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol by 71% and achieved a 52% intensity reduction of the Group’s scope 3 emissions, all since 2015.

There is currently no guidance on this for our industry and we wanted to pioneer a starting point; capturing these downstream impacts in our annual EP&L analysis to understand our products’ full life cycle. So, in October 2019, we launched the ﬁrst major survey of its kind to analyze the behavior patterns of more than 3,000 Luxury fashion consumers across France, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, the USA and Japan. Based on questions around product use and care, as well as length of life and how products were ﬁnally disposed, we developed a speciﬁc methodology to extend our EP&L to include consumer use and end-of-life starting in 2020. Since then, we’ve gained a lot of insights into our clients’ habits once they purchase our products and it has helped to identify areas of material impact and targeted interventions to reduce the associated impacts. For example, in 2022, the consumer use phase and end of life impacts accounted for 8% of our EP&L impact, with the majority coming from ready-to-wear.",

        "data": "Bold ambitions and actions for biodiversity For over a decade, the interface between nature and business has been an important focus for us. We depend on biodiversity for materials like cotton, leather, cashmere and wool to make our Houses’ products and it was important to deepen our understanding of how we impact and depend on it. We’ve been capturing the complexity of land use through our EP&L analysis and it’s our biggest impact after climate, totaling 31% of our Group EP&L. So, making ambitious commitments to protect, restore and regenerate biodiversity was an obvious decision to take; it’s not only essential to be responsible for all our impacts but we’re ensuring supply chain resiliency for the future too. We’ve since moved from commitments and supporting scientiﬁcally-backed frameworks, to having customized programs and clear priorities for addressing biodiversity in, and beyond, our own supply chains. We work with all the main supply chain players, starting from the farming communities themselves, as well as collaborating closely with other sectors linked to fashion’s supply chain, like the food and beauty industries. Our strategically-driven approach is underlined by our biodiversity strategy we published in June 2020. We committed to two main targets: we want to have a net-zero impact on nature by 2025 and to get there we’re regenerating and protecting an area around six times the total land footprint of Kering’s entire supply chain, all the way back to raw material production. Although this part of the supply chain is shared by dozens, if not hundreds, of other companies, we took this entire area of around 350,000 hectares into our calculations. A big part of our approach to biodiversity, and our philosophy as a Group, is to regenerate far more than what we impact. In practical terms, this means we’re working to transform 1 million hectares of farms and landscapes that produce fashion and Luxury’s raw materials to regenerative agriculture, as well as protecting 1 million hectares of critical, irreplaceable habitat outside our supply chain, all by 2025.",

        "data": "Financing mechanisms catalyzing change The transformation of raw material production systems is a top priority for us to help stop and reverse the direct negative impacts that the fashion and Luxury industry has on ecosystems and species. Our biodiversity strategy reﬂects this; it’s built on global expertise and the scientiﬁc consensus that places agriculture as one of the most signiﬁcant drivers of biodiversity loss and climate change. To support our goal to transform 1 million hectares of farms and landscapes to regenerative agriculture in fashion and Luxury’s cotton, wool, cashmere and leather supply chains, we set up an innovative ﬁnancing mechanism with Conservation International in 2021. Our “Regenerative Fund for Nature” aims to scale up regenerative materials for the Luxury and fashion industry by ﬁnancing farmers, NGOs and key stakeholders to move from current agricultural practices, which have high impacts on climate andnature, towards regenerative methods to sequester carbon, mitigate climate change, restore nature, improve localcommunity livelihoods and enhance animal welfare. In September of the same year, we announced the Fund’s ﬁrst seven grantees with projects representing 840,000 hectares across South America, Central Asia, India, Europe and Africa, directly beneﬁting 60,000 people engaged in small and larger scale farming systems. Ultimately these projects will be transformed into regenerative agricultural spaces and we’ve seen good developments within the ﬁrst year; the projects are on track to develop and scale agricultural change on the ground. Consensus in the scientiﬁc community is clear around the need to scale-up ﬁnance and investment in nature-based solutions. We wanted to back this up with action, so we set up another complimentary biodiversity fund mobilizing resources for nature-based solutions in December 2022. Announced during COP15 in Montreal, the “Climate Fund for Nature” is an innovative ﬁnancing mechanism mobilizing resources from the Luxury fashion and beauty sectors; it’s a €300 million fund with €140 million already committed at its launch. In short, the Fund is supporting high-quality projects that contribute to the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems and deliver carbon credits, as well as supporting farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture. The projects will mainly be in the countries where Luxury fashion and beauty source our core raw materials, generating co-beneﬁts for the communities with an emphasis on women. We’re collaborating with Mirova bank to manage the fund and we welcomed the Fund’s ﬁrst partner L’OCCITANE in Montreal. Both the Regenerative Fund for Nature and the Climate Fund for Nature are excellent examples of science-led ﬁnancing mechanisms that are already operational and supporting nature.

ESG criteria may include factors such as a company’s carbon emissions, labor practices, board composition, and ethics policies. ESG is used by investors to assess the sustainability of a company or investment and to make informed decisions about where to allocate their resources.

In 2021, the bank established its Environmental and Social Risk Policy (ESRP) that provides an overview of the bank’s approach towards managing environmental and social risks. The bank introduced the policy to strengthen its capacity to handle and manage these types of risks. This was achieved by outlining eﬀective risk management practices in a methodical and uniform approach that address the following aspects:• Deﬁning roles and responsibilities for managing environmental and social risks within the organization;• Identifying and evaluating environmental and social risks at both customer and portfolio levels, including the bank’s stance on sectors with elevated risk;• Implementing risk management practices and internal controls to\u0018at a Glance address and mitigate environmental and social risks; and• Monitoring environmental and social risks and providing regular updates to the bank’s BoD and senior management to ensure informed decision-making.

We encourage observation and reporting of hazards, near misses and unwanted events, however small, without fear or blame. This allows us to ensure our processes remain appropriate for our operations. Approach Process integrity determines how we perform our roles every day, and includes: health, personal and process safety, quality, environment, security, management of change and compliance. We continue to review, extend and improve our High Level Standards to provide a structured and consistent approach to safety across all our operations. Continual improvement of the standards is driven by the Process Integrity team. Our open and honest reporting captures data from across the entire Group so that we can reduce risks and improve the safe working practices for our business. New staﬀ, contractors and new business acquisitions are rapidly introduced to the Greenergy culture of open and honest reporting. Gap assessments and regular audits are completed on all new business areas to gain an understanding of the Process Integrity culture. A tailored programme of training in safety awareness, hazard observations and Greenergy expectations of safety walks, event reporting and investigations is then developed and implemented. Across the Group, follow-up audits take place to ensure recommendations have been implemented. Our Process Integrity management systems focus strongly on the prevention of unwanted events, however we recognise the potential for such events to occur and the need to be prepared for them. All of our facilities and business operations have eﬀective emergency management plans in place which are reviewed and tested on a regular basis.

In 2022, there were ten reportable injuries across the Group, an increase from 2021 in absolute terms (2021: 3). Whilst reportable injuries have remained stable across UK operations, the increase has been driven by international business acquired in 2021.

We continue to review our processes and update our risk assessments to ensure our processes are appropriate for our business. Every incident is shared across the Greenergy management team, and safety performance reports are compiled weekly and reviewed by the senior management team to ensure full scrutiny and to share lessons across our business.

We take the presence of chrysotile in our core very seriously, and have implemented measures to ensure that its presence does not pose a risk to those handling it. This includes appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilation where required, and conducting a quantitative visual assessment of chrysotile content in the core during geological logging, supplemented by metallurgical analysis. In 2020, we began a third party led, biannual air quality and noise dosimetry sampling program targeting asbestos, airborne respirable dust particulates, and respirable crystalline silica. The objective of this program is to improve our approach to air quality monitoring and exposure controls, thereby protecting the long-term well being of our employees. The program is ongoing.
